                I was interested in joining ACM-W to bring representation and awareness to the nondevelopmental aspects of computing 
                in which women are still significantly underrepresented in. Through ACM-W events, I want to bridge the knowledge and
                networking gap, to foster the crossover between the development and non development aspects of our community. Upon 
                completing my schooling, I hope to pursue a career in software architecture and software ethics.

                I recognized joining ACM-W as an opportunity to engage with the UWB community 
                for a specific reason. I'm passionate about creating a more inclusive environment 
                for women in STEM, as I believe in the importance of diversity in these fields. 
                This goal aligns with my career ambitions in software engineering and reflects my
                dedication to making a meaningful impact.

                I was interested in being part of ACM-W to raise awareness for the lack representation in women in computing. 
                I have had my share of experiences where I was one of the very few women in technology classes. 
                However, now I look forward to experiencing unique opportunities to connect with 
                women who share my passion for technology. My prior involvement in computing projects has not only
                expanded my technical expertise but has also sharpened my ability to work collaboratively in diverse teams, 
                a skill crucial for fostering an inclusive environment within ACM-W. Outside of school and ACM-W I like to 
                travel and explore new places, I also like to spend time outdoors, photography, and spending time with my family and friends. 
                Post graduation, I plan to pursue a career in Business Analytics or anything with data!
                Looking foward to meet everyone in ACM-W!

                I found there to be a lack of community around me for women in tech, 
                which is why I took it upon myself to join ACM-W's mission in creating a 
                supportive environment for women in computing around me. I believe that 
                uplifting one another as women is the ultimate roadmap to success! Where 
                does my roadmap take me? In 5 years, I hope to become a product manager!

                I think its important to seek out and create spaces
                 for women and other underrepresented groups in computing, 
                 a field lacking in diversity, which I hope to do at ACM-W.
                  I look forward to building an amazing community here! In
